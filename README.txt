the both-2k-modal-amp.h5 is the most stable model in our study the other models are to be uploaded later.

additional installation is "ffmpeg" this is important if you want to use the record functionality

run the server/server.js and app/model.py using the commands in the command line:

>node server.js   -> for the application

>python model.py --mode server	-> for the api
